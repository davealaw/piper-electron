### Setting up Piper TTS

This application requires the Piper TTS executable and voice models:

#### Option 1: Use bundled Piper (if available)
If a `piper` executable is included in the project directory, it will be automatically detected.

#### Option 2: Download Piper separately
1. Download Piper from the [official releases](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases)
2. Extract the executable
3. Use the "Choose Piper Executable" button in the app to select it

#### Option 3: Compile Piper from source (Apple Silicon)
For Apple Silicon Mac users who need to compile Piper from source:
- See **[CompilePiper.md](./CompilePiper.md)** for detailed compilation instructions
- This is particularly useful if pre-built binaries don't work on your system
- The guide includes specific steps for resolving Apple Silicon compatibility issues

#### Voice Models
1. Download voice models from [Piper's voice samples](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/)
2. Place `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files in the `voices` directory
3. Or use "Choose Model Folder" to select a custom directory

## Usage

### Basic Text-to-Speech

1. **Configure Piper:** Ensure the Piper executable path is set (first-time setup)
2. **Select a Voice:** Choose from available voice models in the dropdown
3. **Enter Text:** Type or paste text in the text area, or load from a file
4. **Generate Speech:** Click "Speak" to convert text to audio
5. **Play Audio:** Use the built-in controls to play the generated audio

### Loading Text Files

- **Click "Load Text File"** to browse and select a text file
- **Drag and drop** supported text files directly onto the text area
- Supported formats: `.txt`, `.md`, `.html`, `.js`, `.json`, `.css`, `.py`, and more

### Voice Preview

- Select any voice model and click **"Preview Voice"** to hear a sample
- Helps you choose the right voice before processing large amounts of text

### Custom Output

- By default, audio is saved as `piper-output.wav`
- Use **"Browse..."** next to the output field to choose a custom location and filename
- Only WAV format is supported

## Available Voice Models

The application comes with several high-quality voice models:

- **en_US-amy-medium**: American English, female voice
- **en_US-ryan-high**: American English, male voice (high quality)
- **en_GB-northern_english_male-medium**: British English, male voice
- **cori-high**: High-quality female voice
- **jenny**: Female voice
- **kristin**: Female voice
- **norman**: Male voice

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + L**: Load text file
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**: Start speech synthesis
- **Escape**: Cancel current synthesis (if running)

## Configuration Files

The application stores settings in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/piper-electron/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/piper-electron/config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/piper-electron/config.json`

Settings include:
- Last used voice model
- Last entered text
- Window size and position
- Piper executable path
- Model directory path

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Piper path not configured or invalid"**
- Ensure you've selected a valid Piper executable
- Check that the executable has proper permissions
- Try downloading the latest Piper release

**"No voice models found"**
- Verify that `.onnx` and corresponding `.onnx.json` files are in the voices directory
- Ensure model files are not corrupted
- Check that the model directory path is correct

**Audio doesn't play**
- Confirm the output file was created successfully
- Check system audio settings
- Try a different output location with write permissions
